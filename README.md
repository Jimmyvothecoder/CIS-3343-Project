# Emily Bakes Cakes

## Overview

**Emily Bakes Cakes** is a website designed to help Emily streamline her cake 

ordering process and increase profits. Previously, Emily managed orders 

manually on paper, which was inefficient and time-consuming. This project 

introduces a **graphical user interface (GUI) prototype** to digitize her ordering 

system, making the process more efficient, structured, and scalable.
